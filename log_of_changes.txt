Steps to add a new LLM (Phi2)
- Phi2 model from HuggingFace repo is added in prismatic/models/backbones/llm/phi2.py. Since Phi2 is not instruction tuned, there are no constraints for a specific prompt template.
- LoRA layers are added in prismatic/models/backbones/llm/base_llm.py
- update prismatic/models/backbones/llm/__init__.py
- get_peft_model() from HF freezes LLM layers and finetunes only LoRA params. Make sure to comment line-153 in prismatic/models/vlms/prismatic.py 
- update LLM registry in prismaric/models/materialize.py
